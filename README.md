## Requirements
You must have python installed!
It is using a python script to fetch the required information and images from your steam folder and build meters dynamically.

### FileChoose plugin
Settings Paths/Extra Browse buttons use the bundled FileChoose plugin at
`@Resources/Plugins/FileChoose.dll`. If Browse does nothing, confirm the DLL
is present and set `HasFileChooseFlag=1` in Settings. Paths can always be
typed via click-to-edit (InputText).

## Setup
1. Make sure that both paths inside @Resources\SkinInfo.inc are correct. You only need to modify this if your steam installation folder or your Rainmeter installation folder are not in their respective default location.
2. **Optional** Add your non-Steam games. *see section below for more information*
3. Open one of the SteamyRain.ini from the main folder and Click on 'Scan for Games'
4. Wait till it's done and you're good to go.
5. Adjust the settings to your liking.

## Add Non-Steam Games
This part of the process has to be done manually and will only take effect after using 'Scan for Games'

1. Open the @Resrouces\NonSteamGames.inc
2. Add each game using this format:  
```
Egame#="TheNameOfMyGame"
Egame#Path="ThePathToLaunchMyGame"
Egame#Vis=0
```
It does not have to be a game really. It could be any app or url. eg:  
```
Egame1="Photoshop"
Egame1Path="C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Adobe Photoshop 2024.lnk"
Egame1Vis=0
Egame2="RainmeterForums"
Egame2Path="https://forum.rainmeter.net/index.php"
Egame2Vis=0
```
3. Modify the ExtraGamesCount and ExtraGamesCountPLUS variables at the top to reflect the amount of games you added.
In our example above we would set both of these to 2.
4. Inside @Resrouces\img\ELogo and @Resrouces\img\EIcon, add an icon and a logo for each of the games you added.
name them 00#.jpg. '#' reprensent the game number it is associated with.
I would recomend 32x32 for the icon and 460x215 for the logo
5. Run UpdateGames.pyw if you already followed the Setup steps until the end and already clicked on "Scan for Games". Everytime you add new entries to your NonSteamGames.inc file you have to run the python script again or put necessary infos in the *Meters.inc files manually.
6. Done!
